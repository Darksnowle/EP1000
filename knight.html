                      <h3><u>3D Modelling (18 May)</u></h3>
                      
                      <p>For this lesson, we were taught the different techniques on 3D modelling such as revolution, lofting and sculpting. We were then tasked to design our own <b>Knight Chess Piece</b> with reference. Here is my documentation on how i did it:</p>
                      
                      <h3>Knight Chess Piece</h3>
                      
                      <p>To start things off, i first find an image of the chess piece from google as a reference or canvas to aid in the creation of the design. Once that is done, i went on ahead on Fusion 360, and clicked on <b>Insert>Canvas</b>. I then browsed my computer for the downloaded image of my knight piece. Once that is done i <b>Calibrated</b> the image so that its length will be 30mm which is the maximum length according to the specifications. Once that is done, i then started tracing half of the base of the piece, followed by a <b>revolve</b> against the middle point construction line which is the axis of the revolve.</p>

                      <p>Next, i just sketched out the body of the piece as accurately as possible with the combination of line and circle tool to help with the curved edges.</p>

                      <p>I then ended it off by an extrusion of 1.5mm on both sides. My final product is shown below:</p>
