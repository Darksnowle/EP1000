                     <h1>Week 2</h1>
                      <p>For this week, I focused on the hardware side of things. Everything was fine except for the hinge. Since the box itself is small, this means that the hinge will also be small. When i tried 3D printing it, it just would not work. </p>
                      
                      <a href="final/hinge.PNG"><img src="final/hinge.PNG" width=300></a>
                      
                      <p>There are multiple reasons why.</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Since the hinge is small,the structural integrity is not there. Therefore, if i were to screw it onto my box, there is a high probability that my hinge will break</li>
                        <li>Also because of the same reason, my connector is just to small and thin so the possibility of the hinge being able to open the cover without breaking is slim to none.</li>
                      </ol>
                      
                      <p>With that, I got some advice and suggestions from my lecturers and decided to buy a hinge and instead of putting it outside of the box, i have decided to put it inside. Since i no longer have a 3D printed component for my project, I had to find a new way to incoperate it in my project so i decided to 3D print the inside of my box. In my opinion, it looks great however the only downside is that it takes approximately 7 hours to 3D print it. It currently has dimensions of 190mm x 90mm x 45mm. The total box dimension is 200mm x 100mm x 100mm.</p>
