                      <h3>Computer Graphic (11 May)</h3>
                      
                      <p>Computer graphics is sub-divided into 2 categories. <b>Raster Images</b> and also <b>Vector Images</b>.</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Raster Images</b></li><br>
                              <ul>
                                <li>deal with pixels on the screen. It is used mainly for rendering images (e.g. Photographs). Images are represented by “dots” or “pixels” in a set resolution (number of dots/pixels per inch).</li><br>
                                  <li>Characterised by becoming fuzzy as you zoom/enlarge the image. As the image is represented by dots, as you enlarge the image the dots become bigger.</li><br>
                                  <li>Mainly used for photographs and image representation.</li><br>
                                  <li>Important resoultions (measured as dpi (dots per inch)), the higher the amount of memory required to store the image.</li><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>72 dpi Applie/Mac screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>96 dpi Windows screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>300 dpi min Printer resolution</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                  <li>Common raster file formats include - jpg/jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) <b>OR</b> png (Portable Network Graphics)</li>
                                  <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><u><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a></u></li>
                                        <li><u><a href="https://ms-paint.en.softonic.com/">MS Paint</a></u></li>
                                    </ul>
                              </ul><br>
                          
                          <li><b>Vector Images</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uses mathematical functions or algorithms to display images on the screen. <b>e.g.</b> a line is represented by two points and an equation to draw the line between points.</li><br>
                                <li>Characterised by clean lines/edges and the ability to zoom in/out as much as you want without distortion, as each image is “drawn” using an algorithm.</li><br>
                                <li>Great for logos, signs, fancy text and design files.</li><br>
                                <li>As such, you require specific software to handle each image type, and some are proprietary, though some standards exist.</li><br>
                                <li>Common vector file formats include - dxf (AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format) <b>OR</b> svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) <b>OR</b> STEP (STEP. ISO 10303 for 3D Objects)</li><br>
                                <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>

                      <p>This week, we were also introduced to <b>Gimp</b>, a free raster graphic editing software, similar to that of Adobe Photoshop.We were told to pick any picture and to remove and change its background. Here is how I did it.</p>
                      
                    <h3>Gimp</h3>
                      
                      <p><b>Photo Reference:</b></p>
                      <img src="images/tower.jpg" width=500 height=500>
                      <img src="images/dav.jpg" width=500 height="500">
                      
                      <p>I first start off by right clicking the image and click on <b>Add Alpha Channel</b>. Once that is done, i want to duplicate the image. After that what i did was i <b>desaturate</b> the image and <b>invert</b> the colours of the top layer, making it look like this:</p><br>
                      <img src="images/grey.png" width=800>
                      
                      <p>Once that is done, i then take the <b>paintbrush tool</b> to paint the unwanted background with the colour black and my subject with the colour white as such. </p><br>
                      <img src="images/whitebg.png" width=800>
                      
                      <p>After that I <b>cut</b> the image, press on the original layer and add a layer mask, with <b>white (full opacity)</b> selected. Once that is done i went ahead and pasted my image previously. I then anchored the floating layer so that it will anchor it down to the original layer. Last but not least all i did was just drag the new background image to the layers tab, changing the background. I obviously resize it accordingly to produce the final product below.</p>
