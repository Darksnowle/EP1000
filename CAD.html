                      <h3><b>Computer Graphic (11 May)</b></h3>
                      
                      <p>Computer graphics is sub-divided into 2 categories. <b>Raster Images</b> and also <b>Vector Images</b>.</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Raster Images</b></li><br>
                              <ul>
                                <li>deal with pixels on the screen. It is used mainly for rendering images (e.g. Photographs). Images are represented by “dots” or “pixels” in a set resolution (number of dots/pixels per inch).</li><br>
                                  <li>Characterised by becoming fuzzy as you zoom/enlarge the image. As the image is represented by dots, as you enlarge the image the dots become bigger.</li><br>
                                  <li>Mainly used for photographs and image representation.</li><br>
                                  <li>Important resoultions (measured as dpi (dots per inch)), the higher the amount of memory required to store the image.</li><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>72 dpi Applie/Mac screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>96 dpi Windows screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>300 dpi min Printer resolution</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                  <li>Common raster file formats include - jpg/jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) <b>OR</b> png (Portable Network Graphics)</li>
                                  <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><u><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a></u></li>
                                        <li><u><a href="https://ms-paint.en.softonic.com/">MS Paint</a></u></li>
                                    </ul>
                              </ul><br>
                          
                          <li><b>Vector Images</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uses mathematical functions or algorithms to display images on the screen. <b>e.g.</b> a line is represented by two points and an equation to draw the line between points.</li><br>
                                <li>Characterised by clean lines/edges and the ability to zoom in/out as much as you want without distortion, as each image is “drawn” using an algorithm.</li><br>
                                <li>Great for logos, signs, fancy text and design files.</li><br>
                                <li>As such, you require specific software to handle each image type, and some are proprietary, though some standards exist.</li><br>
                                <li>Common vector file formats include - dxf (AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format) <b>OR</b> svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) <b>OR</b> STEP (STEP. ISO 10303 for 3D Objects)</li><br>
                                <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>
                                    <ul>

                      <p>This week, we were also introduced to <b>Gimp</b>, a free raster graphic editing software, similar to that of Adobe Photoshop.We were told to pick any picture and to remove and change its background. Here is how I did it.</p>
                      
                    <h3>Gimp</h3>
                      
                      <p><b>Photo Reference:</b></p>
                      <img src="images/tower.jpg" width=500 height=500>
                      <img src="images/dav.jpg" width=500 height="500">
                      
                      <p>I first start off by right clicking the image and click on <b>Add Alpha Channel</b>. Once that is done, i want to duplicate the image. After that what i did was i <b>desaturate</b> the image and <b>invert</b> the colours of the top layer, making it look like this:</p><br>
                      <img src="images/grey.png" width=800>
                      
                      <p>Once that is done, i then take the <b>paintbrush tool</b> to paint the unwanted background with the colour black and my subject with the colour white as such. </p><br>
                      <img src="images/whitebg.png" width=800>
                      
                      <p>After that I <b>cut</b> the image, press on the original layer and add a layer mask, with <b>white (full opacity)</b> selected. Once that is done i went ahead and pasted my image previously. I then anchored the floating layer so that it will anchor it down to the original layer. Last but not least all i did was just drag the new background image to the layers tab, changing the background. I obviously resize it accordingly to produce the final product below.</p>

                      <h3><b>Autodesk Fusion 360</b></h3>
                    
                      
                      <p>For this lesson we were also introduced to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators"><u>Fusion 360</u></a>, an Integrated CAD, CAM, and CAE software. You can consolidate your product development process. Unify design, engineering, electronics, and manufacturing into a single platform.</p>
                      
                      <p>It is similar to AutoCAD or Inventor. However this program is free for educational use, provided you sign up (using your email) as a registered student of Singapore Polytechnic. It is easy to learn and master as there are alot of tutorials online even from Autodesk itself.</p>
                      
                      <p>We were given our first assignments to get used to the software:</p>
                      <u><a href="documents/Exercise1.f3d">Exercise 1</a></u><br>
                      <u><a href="documents/Exercise2.f3d">Exercise 2</a></u><br>
                      <u><a href="documents/Exercise3.f3d">Exercise 3</a></u><br>
                      
                      <p>Once we were more comfortable with the software, we were given another assignment on the 15th of May, which was to design our own <b>Fidget Spinner</b> and our own <b>Keyring Nametag</b></p>
                      
                      <h3>Fidget Spinner</h3>
                      
                      <p>The process of making our own fidget spinner was quite straight forward.The specifications of the design is:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li> We are provided with a ABEC 608 Bearing dimensions <b>8 x 22 x 7 mm</b> for the rotation device and M8 Stainless Steel hex nuts as counter-weights. </li><br>
                            <li>The radius of the fidget spinner should not exceed 50mm (40mm if you have small hands!) otherwise we will not be able to spin it.</li><br>
                            <li>The maximum thickness of your fidget spinner 8 mm to accommodate the bearing and the M8 nuts.</li>
                        </ul>
                      
                      <p>I first started by creating a 50mm diameter circle as a maxmimum marking for my spinner.I then designed the arm of the spinner according to the dimensions given and added the hexagon to house the nut and the circle in the middle to house the bearing. I then used the circular feature to duplicate the arms evenly. I decided to go for 6 arms. The final thing i did, sketch-wise, was just a random ciruclar ring for design sake. </p>
                      
                      <img src="images/sketch.PNG" width="800">
                      
                      <p>Once that is done, I extrude each side by 4mm since the maximum thickness is 8mm. I lastly used a fillet to fillet the corners. Below is my finished product. </p>
                      
                      <img src="images/spinner.PNG" width="800">
                      
                      <h3>Keyring Nametag</h3>
                      
                      <p>For my next assingment, we were told to design our own keyring or keychain.</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just like before, i started with a sketch of my design. I started with a rectangle shape with the length of 60mm and width of 30mm.</li>
                            <li>I then used the fillet tool on each corner with the radius of 6mm.</li>
                            <li>After that i did an offset of 1.5mm.</li>
                            <li>Lastly I created a circle about 5mm from the middle of the rectangle.</li>
                        </ul>
                             <p>Once done it should look like this. </p>
                      
                      <img src="images/keyringsketch.PNG" width=800>
                      
                      <p>Once that is done, </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I went ahead and extruded the edges by 3.5mm and the inside by 2mm, excluding the circle so as to create the hole to fit the keyring.</li>
                            <li>Once that is done, I did a chamfer of 3mm on the hole so as to allow the keyring to fit easily to the hole.</li>
                            <li>After that, all that is left was to add a text of my name (and also a few extra quotes to make it look nicer), which i then extruded to the same height as the outer edges.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Below is my final product:</p>
