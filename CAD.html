                      <h2><b>Computer Graphic (11 May)</b></h2>
                      
                      <p>Computer graphics is sub-divided into 2 categories. <b>Raster Images</b> and also <b>Vector Images</b>.</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Raster Images</b></li><br>
                              <ul>
                                <li>deal with pixels on the screen. It is used mainly for rendering images (e.g. Photographs). Images are represented by “dots” or “pixels” in a set resolution (number of dots/pixels per inch).</li><br>
                                  <li>Characterised by becoming fuzzy as you zoom/enlarge the image. As the image is represented by dots, as you enlarge the image the dots become bigger.</li><br>
                                  <li>Mainly used for photographs and image representation.</li><br>
                                  <li>Important resoultions (measured as dpi (dots per inch)), the higher the amount of memory required to store the image.</li><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>72 dpi Applie/Mac screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>96 dpi Windows screen resolution</li>
                                            <li>300 dpi min Printer resolution</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                  <li>Common raster file formats include - jpg/jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) <b>OR</b> png (Portable Network Graphics)</li>
                                  <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><u><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a></u></li>

                                    </ul>
                              </ul><br>
                          
                          <li><b>Vector Images</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uses mathematical functions or algorithms to display images on the screen. <b>e.g.</b> a line is represented by two points and an equation to draw the line between points.</li><br>
                                <li>Characterised by clean lines/edges and the ability to zoom in/out as much as you want without distortion, as each image is “drawn” using an algorithm.</li><br>
                                <li>Great for logos, signs, fancy text and design files.</li><br>
                                <li>As such, you require specific software to handle each image type, and some are proprietary, though some standards exist.</li><br>
                                <li>Common vector file formats include - dxf (AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format) <b>OR</b> svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) <b>OR</b> STEP (STEP. ISO 10303 for 3D Objects)</li><br>
                                <li>Some softwares you can look into inlcudes:</li><br>
                                    <ul>

                      <p>This week, we were also introduced to <b>Gimp</b>, a free raster graphic editing software, similar to that of Adobe Photoshop.We were told to pick any picture and to remove and change its background. Here is how I did it.</p>
                      
                    <h2>Gimp</h2>
                      
                      <h4>The photo below shows the final product of my GIMP assignment. There will be a link that will bring you to a page showing the steps that i took.</h4>

                      <h2><b>Autodesk Fusion 360</b></h2>
                    
                      
                      <p>For this lesson we were also introduced to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators"><u>Fusion 360</u></a>, an Integrated CAD, CAM, and CAE software. You can consolidate your product development process. Unify design, engineering, electronics, and manufacturing into a single platform.</p>
                      
                      <p>It is similar to AutoCAD or Inventor. However this program is free for educational use, provided you sign up (using your email) as a registered student of Singapore Polytechnic. It is easy to learn and master as there are alot of tutorials online even from Autodesk itself.</p>
                      
                      <p>We were given our first assignments to get used to the software. Here is my documentation on it:</p>
                      <u><a href="Exercise1.html">Exercise 1</a></u><br>
                      <u><a href="Exercise2.html">Exercise 2</a></u><br>
                      <u><a href="Exercise3.html">Exercise 3</a></u><br>
                      
                      <p>Once we were more comfortable with the software, we were given another assignment on the 15th of May, which was to design our own <b>Fidget Spinner</b> and our own <b>Keyring Nametag</b></p>
                      
                      <h3>Fidget Spinner</h3>
                      
                      <h4>Below is my finished fidget spinner design and also the link to the steps I took to make the spinner.</h4>

                      <p>For this lesson, we were taught the different techniques on 3D modelling such as revolution, lofting and sculpting. We were then tasked to design our own <b>Knight Chess Piece</b> with reference. Here is my documentation on how i did it:</p>

                      <h2>Fusion 360 Features (22 May)</h2>
                      
                      <p>For this lesson, we were taught on different Fusion 360 features. One particular one is called <b>Parametric Modelling</b>.</p>
                        
                      <h4>Parametric Modelling</h4>
                      <p>This feature allows you to define your drawings/sketches using variables. This feature can be found at <b>Modify > Change Parameters</b>.</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>The workflow is as follows:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Draw your sketch</li>
                                    <li>Use Modify > Change Parameters to define variables for the dimensions</li>
                                    <li>Apply the variables to the dimensions</li>
                                    <li>Should you change your paramters, the sketch/object changes.</li>
                                </ul>
                              <li>In the parameters box you define:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>the name of the parameter</li>
                                    <li>the type of the parameter e.g. mm</li>
                                    <li>a value (which can be changed)</li>
                                    <li>a comment to identify the parameter created</li>
                                </ul>
                          </ul>
                      <p>You will be able to see how I implemented this feature with the assignment given to me which is to make my own laptop stand.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Laptop Stand</h3>

                      <h3>Parametric Box (29 May)</h3>
                      <p>To continue our understanding on parametric modelling, we were tasked to design our own type of box while implementing the parametric tool. Forthis, I made two designs, The first one being the one where i followed the video tutorial given and the second one being my own design where i implemented all the things i learned from designing the first box.</p>
                      
                      <h4>Below is the finished product of the first box i made and the link showing the steps I took in designing it:</h4>
