                      <p>For my next assingment, we were told to design our own keyring or keychain.</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just like before, i started with a sketch of my design. I started with a rectangle shape with the length of 60mm and width of 30mm.</li>
                            <li>I then used the fillet tool on each corner with the radius of 6mm.</li>
                            <li>After that i did an offset of 1.5mm.</li>
                            <li>Lastly I created a circle about 5mm from the middle of the rectangle.</li>
                        </ul>
                             <p>Once done it should look like this. </p>
                      
                      <img src="images/keyringsketch.PNG" width=800>
                      
                      <p>Once that is done, </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I went ahead and extruded the edges by 3.5mm and the inside by 2mm, excluding the circle so as to create the hole to fit the keyring.</li>
                            <li>Once that is done, I did a chamfer of 3mm on the hole so as to allow the keyring to fit easily to the hole.</li>
                            <li>After that, all that is left was to add a text of my name (and also a few extra quotes to make it look nicer), which i then extruded to the same height as the outer edges.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Below is my final product:</p>
