                  <p><b>On our second lesson, on the <u>24th of April</u>, we were introduced to HTML, the basic start to creating a webpage.</b></p><br>
                
                <h2>We were told about multiple different text editors. Some of which include:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3>Sublime Text</h3><br>
                            <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"> <img src="images/sublime-icon.png" alt="sublime text" width="500"></a>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><h3>Atom</h3><br>
                            <a href="https://www.atom.io"> <img src="images/atom.jpg" alt="Atom" width=500></a>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><h3>Notepad++</h3><br>
                            <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" > <img src="images/notepad.jpeg" alt="notepad++" width=500></a>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><h3>Brackets</h3><br>
                            <a href="https://brackets.io"> <img src="images/brackets.png" alt="brackets" width=500></a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                
                <hr>
                
                <p><b>I personally use Brackets as my main text editor but it's mainly based on self preference.</b></p>
                
                <p><b>The reason i prefer using Brackets is because of its convenience. I do not really have to type out the full command as all i have to do is choose from the list of commands shown by the programme. I am also able to see the live preview of my webpage.</b></p>
                
                <p><b>After we found our preferred text editor, we were told to watch videos on how HTML works. To be specific, the two recommended videos are from Jack Wright. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk"><u>Learn HTML in 12 Minutes</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ13lX20FqU&t=122s"><u>Learn More HTML in 12 Minutes</u></a></b></p><br>
                
                <h2>Use of HTML</h2>
                
                <h3>Here are the basic steps to using HTML:</h3>
                    
                    <p>Before you begin, you will need to create a new <b>.html</b> document.</p> 
                    
                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> You have to first ensure that the <b>file name extensions</b> is turned on. You can do so by pressing the <b>view</b> button in the folder and pressing on the <b>file name extensions</b>. This is to enable you to edit your file type.</p><br>
                            <img src="images/extensionjpg.jpg" width=800 border="3"><br>
                    
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b> Now, you will have to create a new <b>text document</b> and rename it, preferably to <b>index</b>, with the extension <b>.html</b> at the end.</p><br>
                        <img src="images/test.png" width="800" border="3"><br>
                    
                    <p><b>Step 3:</b> Now, you can right click on it and <b>open with</b> your preferred text editor. As for me it is ofcourse with Brackets. The other way you can do that is by opening </p><br>
                    
                        <img src="images/open.png" width="800" border="3"><br>
                
                    <p><b>OR</b> You can also open that file through your text editor. Simply click on <b>File</b>><b>Open</b> and find your <b>index.html</b> folder.</p><br>
                
                    <img src="images/new.png" width="800" border="3"><br>
                
                    <p><b>Step 4:</b> You can now start writting down code. I have written down the template of what a basic html code should look like down below.</p><br>
                
                        <img src="images/start.png"><br>
                
                    <p>This is what it should look like. As i previously mentioned, the neat thing about <b>Brackets</b> is that you can get a live preview of your webpage. You can simply do so by pressing the lightning looking button at the right side.</p>
